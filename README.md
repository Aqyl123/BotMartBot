# BotMartBot

Made by Aqyl#0093

A simple Discord bot using BotMart's API to gather lowest ask price information for all bots and groups available on their site.

GET STARTED:
- Get your Discord Bot Token from https://discord.com/developers/applications
- Paste your bot token on `Line 21`
- Commands for the bot can be found in the `!help` command.
- Make sure your `discord.py` version is up to date.

Use `python botmart.py` to start.

UPDATE  (7/22/20):
- Fixed the 'Supports:' section to be fully automated now.

<b>DISCLAIMER: As this is a fairly new site and there hasn't been much activity on the site, some of the prices won't be there and some Lifetime prices will not show up as there are no records of sales/listings on the site. I will update the bot as soon as some more traffic is brought to the site.</b>
